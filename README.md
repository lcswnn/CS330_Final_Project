**HOW IT WORKS**

This programming assignment has the ability to "lock and unlock" a mechanism and uses an already set sequence of numbers as the locking and unlocking codes. These codes are the last 5 digits of an A number, followed by a 1 to unlock and a 4 to lock. This program first guesses a random number, and does so until the number it comes up with contains the locking or the unlocking code preset by the programmer. It then will tell you how long it took to find a number that locked/unlocked a code. To follow the criteria of testing, the locking code was commented out, and the system was tested to see how fast it can guess a number that contains the codes.

**HOW TO BUILD AND RUN EXECUTABLE**

Buidling an executable is a somewhat annoying process on MacOS. First, you have to create new folders in the finder and then create new 'classes' and 'sources' folders. You then drag the .java files into the 'sources' folder. You then go into your terminal and type some terminal commands to create .class files of your .java files. After that, you create your manifest.txt files and also save that into your 'classes' folder. After that, you have to use more terminal commands and then you end up with an executable file you can send to others. To run the executable, you just need to download and open the .jar file and the file should prompt you to click abutton to run the program and get numbers that are interesting to see and help with your predictions needed in part 2. You could also go to the GitHub upload of the .jar file, click "view raw" and click the downloaded file. This should be able to run the file as well.

**HOW TO GENERATE UNIT TEST COVERAGE**

Unit test coverage in this program is generated by the JUnit Testing in java. The unit test coverage would come from the pop-up window that the JUnit testing would be found in. The testing window would turn green when the tests all pass, and red if the tests all fail. You can also find if something is not used in the program. This is found by looking at if anyting in the program is underlined yellow. If so, then it is not used in the program and therefore is not used or covered. 

**PLATFORM BEING TESTED ON**

All of this is being coded on Eclipse IDE.
Tested .jar files on MacOS and Windows 11.
Files uploaded to GitHub.
