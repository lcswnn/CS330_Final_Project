# CS330_Final_Project

**HOW IT WORKS**

This programming assignment has the ability to "lock and unlock" a mechanism and uses an already set sequence of numbers as the locking and unlocking codes (810831 = Unlocking Code. 810834 = Locking Code.) These codes are the last 5 digits of an A number, followed by a 1 to unlock and a 4 to lock. As you type into the text box prompted by the program, the computer will read your inputs and as you type a stream of digits, will tell you if you locked or unlocked the mechanism. If you type the unlocking code, the program will tell you it was unlocked, and same with the locking code.

**HOW TO BUILD AN EXECUTABLE**

First, the Keypad class was created. This created the consturctors for the GUI class to take in the values of the variables used. After the Keypad was finished, the GUI class was created. This is the execuatble Java file that can run when turned into the .jar file. In the GUI class was the public static void method that executes the code when you run in the IDE and the .jar file through the terminal. The GUI class creates a Guided-User-Interface that consists of a JFrame (the window itself), a JLabel that tells the user if the mechanism is unlocked or not, and a JTextField that the user can type a string of numbers and characteres into. 

To turn the GUI.java file into a .jar file, you can use Eclipse's "**File -> Export**" feature. You can export the file as a Runnable .jar file to a directory of your choosing. This then creates a runnable, execuatble .jar file that you can open just by clicking on, or through the terminal. The .jar file would have the same Guided-User-Interface as the program in the IDE. This .jar file was then uploaded to GitHub along with the updated .java files.

**HOW TO RUN THE EXECUTABLE**

To run the executable, you can do one of two things. You can either open the terminal, navigate to where the .jar file is located, and type into the terminal, "**java -jar RunnableGUI.jar**". This will run the .jar file like you just clicked it straight and will open the Guided Interface for you to interact with. Or, you can save the .jar file to a directory of your choosing and double click the file. This will also open the JFrame and GUI and will allow you to run the executable.

**HOW TO GENERATE UNIT TEST COVERAGE**

Unit test coverage in this program is generated by the JUnit Testing in java. The unit test coverage would come from the pop-up window that the JUnit testing would be found in. The testing window would turn green when the tests all pass, and red if the tests all fail. You can also find if something is not used in the program. This is found by looking at if anyting in the program is underlined yellow. If so, then it is not used in the program and therefore is not used or covered. 

**PLATFORM BEING TESTED ON**

Coded on Eclipse IDE.

Tested .jar files on MacOS and Windows 11.

Files uploaded to GitHub.
