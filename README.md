# CS330_Final_Project

This programming assignment has the ability to "lock and unlock" a mechanism and uses an already set sequence of numbers as the locking and unlocking codes. These codes are the last 5 digits of an A number, followed by a 1 to unlock and a 4 to lock. This program first guesses a random number, and does so until the number it comes up with contains the locking or the unlocking code preset by the programmer. It then will tell you how long it took to find a number that locked/unlocked a code. To follow the criteria of testing, the locking code was commented out, and the system was tested to see how fast it can guess a number that contains the codes.

Buidling the executable was a simple process. You're able to take a Object-Oriented Programming approach to this. First, just create a constructor containing the locking and unlocking codes that the program needs to guess. Then, you're able to make a keypad object in the running/application part of the code. This will then make it so you can use the variables in your coding statements. I commented out the part of the code where it can check to see if the code is locked or unlocked to give me a better understanding as to how long it would take for someone to guess the unlock code. However, if you wanted to find how ong it would take to either lock or unlock, you can uncomment it and the program will tell you. To run, at least in the Eclipse IDE, you just needed to press the run button and it would tell you. You can set the codes to anything you want and the computer would have to guess those numbers.

Unit test coverage in this program is generated by the JUnit Testing in java. The unit test coverage would come from the pop-up window that the JUnit testing would be found in. The testing window would turn green when the tests all pass, and red if the tests all fail. You can also find if something is not used in the program. This is found by looking at if anyting in the program is underlined yellow. If so, then it is not used in the program and therefore is not used or covered.
