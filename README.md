# CS330_Final_Project

This programming assignment has the ability to "lock and unlock" a mechanism and uses an already set sequence of numbers as the locking and unlocking codes. These codes are the last 5 digits of an A number, followed by a 1 to unlock and a 4 to lock. This program first guesses a random number, and does so until the number it comes up with contains the locking or the unlocking code preset by the programmer. It then will tell you how long it took to find a number that did just that.
